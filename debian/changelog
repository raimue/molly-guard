molly-guard (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now should also work in su/sudo sessions because it now checks whether the
    creator of the current tty/pts is sshd, rather than the brittle check for
    the environment. Thanks to Craig Small and Don Armstrong for their sparks
    of brilliance (closes: #425831).
  * Corrected a typo in the package description (closes: #408706).
