molly-guard (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Shield shutdown -h; I am terribly sorry, Andrew! (closes: #426107).
    Now only shutdown -c and * --help are passed through regardless.
  * Added --help option, which now prints a short molly-guard help message
    followed by the actual command's help output.
  * Now should also work in su/sudo sessions because it now checks whether the
    creator of the current tty/pts is sshd, rather than the brittle check for
    the environment. Thanks to Craig Small and Don Armstrong for their sparks
    of brilliance (closes: #425831).
  * Corrected a typo in the package description (closes: #408706).
  * Added --pretend-ssh option to facilitate testing.
