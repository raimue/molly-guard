molly-guard TODO
================

- add a configuration file which can be used to disable molly-guard
  completely, or blanket-prevent any of the commands (so there's not even
  a prompt) for remote machines that need not be rebooted ever. or something
  like that.

- sudo munges $SSH_CONNECTION, so invent something for people who login to
  remote machines a non-root and use sudo to reboot/halt/shutdown.
