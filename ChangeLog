  Version 0.4.5
  [ Martin F. Krafft]
  * Use tty tool to detect the tty of stdin, rather than /proc/*/fd/0, which
    is Linux-specificy.

  [ Ludovico Gardenghi ]
  * Check the process tree from the shell up to init and look for a 'sshd'
    process.

  Version 0.3.2
  * Don't fail if the SSH_CONNECTION variable is unset.

2008-03-12 martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>

  Version 0.3.1
  * Pass --short option to hostname to prevent the user from having to type
    the whole FQDN at times.
  * Check for the $SSH_CONNECTION variable in addition to the pty checks.
  * Add a basic REAMDE file.

  Version 0.3
  * Shield shutdown -h; I am terribly sorry, Andrew!
    Now only shutdown -c and * --help are passed through regardless.
  * Added --help option, which now prints a short molly-guard help message
    followed by the actual command's help output.
  * Now should also work in su/sudo sessions because it now checks whether the
    creator of the current tty/pts is sshd, rather than the brittle check for
    the environment. Thanks to Craig Small and Don Armstrong for their sparks
    of brilliance.
  * Added --pretend-ssh option to facilitate testing.
